 Code to get data from São Paulo's Secretary for Public Security

Here, I share the code that I used to make a web scraping with Selenium.
This code makes possible to get all data from São Paulo's Secretary for Public Security for the year of 2019, and just São Paulo's Police Departments.

My browser is chrome, that's why I have chromedriver.exe at the same folder of python's script. However, if you are using a diferent browser, you're gonna need to change this file. Take a look here for more details: [`selenium installation`](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
